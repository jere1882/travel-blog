## Colombia

In 2022, in an attempt to strengthen our recently formalized relationship, I joined my partner in his pre-planned trip to Colombia. I must have been really eager to travel with him, Colombia had always ranked low in my list of countries to visit and it was not easily reachable from the UK.

It was a trip of first-times: my first ever couple trip, my first stay at a hostel, my first time in the Caribbean Sea and the first Latin American country I visited far from home. 

With the notable exception of the charming colonial city of Cartagena de Indias, I must admit that I did not find the country very appealing, and I would certainly not go back. Cartagena is OK, but otherwise I can only remember unremarkable beaches, striking poverty and a severe case of food poisoning caused by the breakfast of my hotel.

### Prelude: Never fly Air Canada

When you search for international flights from/to South America, often the first result that  pops up is an Air Canada itinerary with a stopover in e.g. Toronto. I purchased one of these because it was literally half the price than any other option, and I usually don't mind long stopovers.
I soon came to regret my decision. Canada has insane rules for transfer passengers. Even if you are only there for a 2-hour stopover, you are required to apply for a ludicrously complicated transit visa. This involves:

1. Filling in an endless questionnaire online (at least 1 hour of filling every tiny detail of your life, including whether you have ever had any ETS to every small trip you have made in the last 5 years). Literally just as thorough as a USA B1/B2 visa.   
2. Showing up at the Canadian Consolate in London and leaving them your passport.
3. Waiting for an undetermined span of time, usually one week, for them to mail your passport back to you with a transit visa that is valid only once.

It was a very stressful, time consuming and expensive process. My passport arrived just in time, a few days before departure. On the upside, the airports in Canada are top notch and the views of the snowy cities were amazing.

### San Andres

After Air Canada dropped me in Bogota, I boarded a domestic flight with Latam Airlines to San Andres. The airport is next to the small main town, and I spent my first day resting and walking around.

![[img_colombia_2022_041.png]]

San Andres is not a large island. It belongs to Colombia but it's actually a little deep into the Caribbean Sea, right in front of Nicaragua. The main town is at the northern tip (see map) and had the feeling of a tourist destination that had seen its peak decades ago, perhaps in the 90s or the 2000s. I could somehow see many of the aged buildings, especially hotels, looking grand in their heyday.

![[img_colombia_2022_042.png]]

My boyfriend had insisted on booking a hostel because "it provides a great chance to socialize and it's also cheap". We checked in to derelict "Viajero Hostel" shortly after he arrived, which was in notable need of repairs. Then we spent some time chilling at the main beach in the town, Sprat Bight.

![[img_colombia_2022_036.jpeg]]

The hostel offered scrambled eggs for breakfast. Thank God a second serving was not allowed, because one was enough to cause me a serious episode of food poisoning that had me in bed for two days.

Perhaps my favourite memory from San Andres is that we rented a golf car to go around the island, which takes only a few hours. Naturally, the golf car broke shortly after we left the town, as soon as we entered an area with poor phone coverage. But we did get a replacement in time to continue the adventure.

![[img_colombia_2022_037.jpeg]]
I was the designated driver, and we went clockwise around the island west -> south -> east ; the highlights:

- Eco Parque West View (paid entrance), where you can do great snorkel and a jump to the sea on a large slide. The place is very scenic, but a little crowded.
- Rocky and sandy beaches around the island: you can stop at a number of secluded, natural beaches. We sat in a log, drank a few beers, and enjoyed the white sand and crystal clear waters.
- A furious storm suddenly erupted, we were soaked while driving with nowhere to cover. It was funny at first but then it was really uncomfortable.

We stayed there more days at Hotel Cocoplum Beach, located in the west coast, away from the town. The rooms were very comfortable, and the best part was the endless hotel beach, from which you can swim/walk to the Rocky Cay (about 100 meters inside the calm sea). The wreck of the cargo ship **Nicodemus** is right next to the Rocky Cay, offering nice views and great snorkelling.

We also booked a diving trip on a morning, and they took us to see an underwater Poseidon surrounded by colourful fish. I was already an experienced diver, but Leo did his baptism here, which I highly recommend because the waters are calm and the fish plentiful.

### Cartagena de Indias

From San Andres, we flew to Caratagena de Indias, located in the Caribbean coast of mainland Colombia. The city center features an impressive array of fortifications including walls and a few strongholds; and the city has a magnetic colonial feeling.

We stayed south of the city center, in the modern district of Bocagrande, at one of the tallest skyscrappers: Palermo Sunset. I had never ever stayed in such a high floor, it is perhaps one of the most beautiful stays I ever experienced: sea view, artificial lake view, impressive heights, modern and comfortable.

![[img_colombia_2022_005.jpeg]]

We did a walking guided tour of the city center, and complemented it with a few extra landmarks of our own choosing. It was sunny and a little hot, but we walked ourselves ragged and explored every corner of the city. I really enjoyed it.

After we ticked all the highlights of the colonial old town, we visited Getsemani, famous for its street art and youthful vibe.
![[img_colombia_2022_016.jpeg]]

Finally, we walked around the port trying to find a suitable place to purchase a day trip for the next day to Isla Baru. I remember we were exhausted at that point, having walked all day under the scorching sun. Literally all vendors seem like scams, so we were undecided where to book.

*Regular coffee stops were instrumental in fuelling the trip. This one was at the famous coffee shop "San Alberto"*

As planned, we enjoyed the sunset view from Baluarte Santo Domingo. It was a pretty popular and crowded spot, so we contented ourselves with drinking a beer in a random corner.

Cartagena is very rich in history. Founded in 1533, Cartagena quickly became a vital Spanish port on the Caribbean coast. It features a well protected natural bay, ideal for ships to anchor. Thus, it developed into a hub for trade of gold, silver and enslaved Africans.

It served as a treasure route stop for ships that sailed from South America to Havana and then Spain. In the late 16th Century, Cartagena became one of the largest entry ports for enslaved Africans.

Because of this wealth and role, pirates, privateers (pirates with licence) and rival European powers constantly attacked (Enlgand, France). To defend the treasure and people, the Spanish Crown invested heavily:
* Walls were built between 16th and 18th Century
* Castillo San Felipe de Barajas: A colossal fortress on a hill
* Multiples forts and bastions, guarding the bay entrance and inner harbor

Cartagena declared independence in 1811. Today, the walls and forts are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
### Day trip to Isla Baru

Early in the next morning we joined a group tour to Isla Baru. The tour was a little... chaotic and unprofessionally run. The guys who ran it were clearly desperate to get the money, not prepared, underpaid and totally unconcerned about their natural environment.

![[img_colombia_2022_023.jpeg]]

There was a great snorkelling stop in front of Playa Blanca Baru, not quite in the beach but inside the sea, where we stopped for a while:

![[img_colombia_2022_045.png]]

I was aghast at an illegal stop we did at a protected area, full of manglares (mangroves) and cute raccoons. Problem was that the tour "guides" were desperately feeding the raccoons so that they'd get closer to tourists and get pictures with them (likely just hoping for a tip). Everybody was utterly damaging and disrespectful to the mangroves, climbing out of the boat, damaging the trees and harassing the raccoons.

![[img_colombia_2022_024.jpeg]]

We had some free time in a beach next to the Decameron hotel. Funnily, there was a clash between the hotel staff and a lady leading a group of activists. The hotel was claiming exclusive rights to the beach, and the lady was arguing ferociously, recording, etc.

![[img_colombia_2022_025.jpeg]]
The main stop was Playa Blanca, the best beach around with white sand and crystal clear water. Unfortunately you had to walk through a series of extremely poor, derelict tents and shops to reach the beach, and it left me shocked at the level of poverty and depravation of Colombia. 

Even after you reach the beach, you are meters away from utmost poverty, and you are harassed by an endless succession of locals trying to sell you crap. Moreover, the place was extremely crowded. Despite the considerable length of the beach, there was no way to get some privacy or calm to appreciate the beauty. I would not take a tour like this again, ever.

### Bogota

Most travel guides don't recommend spending much time in Bogota, if any at all. We decided to give it a try in our last two days. We stayed in a fancy neighborhood called Parque 93, at a modern Novotel.

The highlight of the city was the Gold Museum, since Colombia has one of the richest pre-Columbian gold heritages in the world. It shows more than 34000 golden pieces, plus many other archaological objects from all over the country. I was pleasantly surprised to find such a world-class museum, with carefully curated exhibits.

Plaza de Bolivar is the main square of the country, located in La Candelaria. It features a statue of Simon Bolivar, and it's surrounded by the main Cathedral, the Lievano Palace and the congress.

We had such low expectations for Bogota that we ended up having a good time. We stated mostly within the nicer neighbourhoods and took it very easy. 

### Remarks and feelings

Colombia offers a mix of beaches, Caribbean flair, colonial charm, and Latin American energy. With affordable domestic flights, it’s easy to see different regions in one trip. Although it didn’t fully win me over and I probably wouldn’t return, I understand why many travelers do.

For me, Colombia will always be special as the first place I visited with my partner, and the starting point of many more journeys together.
