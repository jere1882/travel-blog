# Day 0: Rio de Janeiro

The day started quite early in Rosario, taking a 3AM bus (El Rosarino) to Aeroparque. After a few hours in the VIP lounge, we boarded a Gol flight to Rio. This was the first time I was traveling with Leo's family.

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_038.jpg]]

At ~1 PM  we finally landed in Rio, after many hours of hassle. Uber is super organized and cheap, and we were soon riding to Copacabana (~1 hour away from the airport). The hotel was a little dated, like most hotels in this area, but was located right in Av. Atlantica, the main street in Copacabana beachfront.

We enjoyed the view from atop the hotel, had lunch, and then walked down to the beach. I particularly enjoyed playing in the sea because it had quite strong waves! I got a little annoyed after a while because the sun was **so strong**. This was common across the vacations: sunset is before 7 PM, but up to 5PM the sun literally scorches you. And Leo's family is just happy to boil to death.

Anyways. With the energy that only the first day usually entails, we rode scooters up to Ipanema with Leo's nieces, and drank some juices watching the sunset at a cute beach stand. Beautiful.

*Sunset at Ipanema*

I was amazed at the crowds, so so many people around, and so so many good looking, probably gay men. Literally I felt a terrible FOMO.

By the evening I was completely exhausted. We had lunch next to the hotel and I fell fast asleep right after.

## Day 1: Working from Angra

This day I had to wake up solo at 5.45 AM, grab breakfast super fast and Uber to the bus station. The bus station was, like most bus stations, chaotic. I boarded the 7.10 AM  Costa Verde bus headed for Angra because I had many meetings scheduled around noon.

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_053.jpg]]

The ride was uncomfortable,  I was terrible sleepy and did not have a window seat, and I distinctly remember having horrible nightmares in the first half of the trip. That said, the bus had decent AC and was punctual.

After a short stop where I had some coffee I slowly revived, and I realized we were traversing really wild, jungle-like territory. I was too groggy to appreciate it much. Arrival at Angra Dos Reis was around 11.30 AM, I walked 20 minutes under the scorching sun to the hotel. The sun was blazing like crazy, I could feel my skin burning and hated the summer so much.

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_054.jpg]]
*The humidity is SO high that these plants manage to keep water contained at all times*

I was annoyed and moody until I finished job meetings, then tried to chill and reset my mind to vacation mode in the hotel pool. The hotel (Nacional Inn) was nice enough, especially the pool which visually looked as if ending in the sea.![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_055.jpg]]

## Day 2: Ilhas Paradisiacas tour

We did a 6-hour group tour  (180R each) that departed from the hotel, a boat picked us up and stopped in a number of islands and beaches; about 1 hour stops at each place.

* Ilhas Botinas . snorkelling spot
* Praia do Dentista 
* Lunch stop at Oraia das Flechas (Isla Gipoia) -> caipirinhas and fried chicken for lunch
* Ponta da Piedade -> decent snorkelling, a cute church.

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_057.jpg]]
*ilhas botinas  people would jump either with a spaghetti or just with your swimsuit and swim/snorkel. this was the best snorkeling spot, we saw a squid, first time for me*

# Day 3: Diving in Ilha Grande & Christmas Evening

This was a solo day, exhausting and rewarding. The logistics were a nightmare:

* Wake up at 6 AM, grab breakfast
* Uber to Santa Luzia, the ferry terminal
* Queue for the 7.30 AM transfer
* 1h+ boat transfer to Abraao, the main town at Ilha Grande
* Walk around the town a bit while drinking a coffee, then show up at the dive shop Dive&Cia
* 1h+ sail towards the first diving spot
* 50' dive 1
* 2+ sail towards the second diving spot (we had to backtrack because the driver lost a camera..)
* 50' dive 2
* 1h+ sail back to Abraao
* 1h+ sail Abraao -> Santa Luzia
* Uber to the hotel

Abraao is charming, a bit chaotic, very lively. I was only free to stroll the waterfront for about 30 minutes, probably enough.

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_042.jpg]]
*First view of Abraao*

The dives were worth the long day, I saw quite a lot of marine life: large starfish, a seahorse, many sergeant major, super colourful corals (different textures and colors: yellow, green, red, blue), honeycomb cowfish, angelfish, porkfish, a bunch of unique flying gurnard (I'd never seen those!).

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_044.jpg]]
*Before the first dive*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_034.png]]
*We dived near the north side of the island*
ers, at times I feared I'd miss the dive guide. I struggled with my belt and weights, it got released halfway the dive.. the belt was super poor quality, and the guides were quite unfriendly. The boat was also super loaded and slooow!

*Streets of Abraao*

So, I was happy and also terrible tired off at ~ 6pm when I arrived back at the hotel. And I was sleepy and bored through the Christmas Dinner, which was a little dense for me. Yet, Leo's family is very healthy and warm, so we had a good time.

## Marine Life :) 

### Sea Stars
![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_027.jpg]]
*Cushioned sea star*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_047.jpg]]
*Cushioned sea star, closeup. Check out the spines! Cushion stars can reach up to 40 cm and move very slowly using hundreds of tiny tube feet on its underside.*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_002.jpg]]
Brazilian red sea star (Echinaster brasiliensis)

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_010.jpg]]
*Possibly a Common Comet Star

> 101 stars!  Sea stars (often called starfish, though they aren’t fish) are marine invertebrates belonging to the group of echinoderms.
> 
> * They *have a mouth* and can push their stomach out through the mouth to digest food outside their body!
> * Most have five arms, but some species have more.
> * They move slowly using tine tube feet, about 2 to 15 cm per minute.
> * They have no brain, they have a nerve ring and radial nerves on each arm.
> * Some species have simple eyes at the tip of each arm, able to detect light and dark (not detailed images)
> * They can regenerate! Many sea stars can regrow arms, and some can regrow an entire body from a single arm
> * Most stars have separate sexes and reproduction happens by broadcast spawning. Some species can reproduce asexually by splitting.

### Corals & Landscapes

The density and color of corals was impressive, particularly of bright shades of yellow, red, blue, pink and green.

*On the right, we can see a colony of *

*A wall of multicolor sun corals*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_005.jpg]]
*Sun Coral (gsnus tubastraea), a beautiful yet major invasive species. It comes in beautiful green, orange and yellow versions*
![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_008.jpg]]
*More sun coral*
![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_003.jpg]]
![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_009.jpg]]
*Xeniidae coral (red), invasive*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_013.jpg]]
*Looking very much like green peas,  this may be Caulerpa racemosa*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_026.jpg]]

*Visibility was really poor - Look divers fade at a short distance: you can barely see beyond 5 meters*
### Fish

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_004.jpg]]
*Sargeant Major, the most common fish throughout the dives and snorkel experiences.*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_025.jpg]]
French Angelfish

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_022.jpg]]
*Porcupinefish (Chilomycterus spinosus): Inflates its spiky body to scare predators and can release toxins, making it one of the ocean’s “puffiest” defenses.*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_021.jpg]]
*Honeycomb Cowfish (Acanthostracion polygonius): Named for its hexagonal patterned armor, it swims awkwardly but looks like a living geometric sculpture.*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_020.jpg]]
*Flying Gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans): Opens its enormous pectoral fins like wings to startle predators and glide short distances along the sea floor.*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_033.png]]
*Porkfish  (Anisotremus virginicus)*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_035.png]]
*Squid! I had never seen one. Apparently a Caribbean Reef Squid*. 

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_036.png]]
*Caribbean Reef Squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea): Masters of color change, they flash vivid patterns to communicate, camouflage, and confuse predators.*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_032.png]]
*Filefish, which resembles a lot the Triggerfish from French Polynesia (Stephanolepis hispidus)*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_031.png]]
*Sand Perch (Diplectrum formosum)*
### Bonus 

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_006.jpg]]
*Bearded Fireworm (Hermodice carunculata): A bristly, bright red worm with venomous bristles that can sting painfully if touched.*

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_017.jpg]]
*I spent 5 minutes happily swimming with a turtle. Somehow I lost the video, and all I have left is this cropped pic. Such noble cleatures! *
### Sea Horse!
I was lucky enough to see two sea horses, the one I managed to get good pics of was a Hippocampus reidi (Longsnout Seahorse).

> **101 seahorses!** Seahorses are tiny marine fish with horse-shaped heads and upright swimming posture.
> * Bodies are covered in bony rings instead of scales.
> * Tail is prehensile, used for grasping seagrass or coral branches.
> * Size varies: **10–20 cm** for longsnout species.*
> * Swim very slowly using tiny dorsal fins for propulsion.
> * Males carry eggs in a brood pouch, where embryos develop safely. After gestation, males “give birth” to fully formed miniature seahorses.
> * Can change color to blend with surroundings: coral, seagrass, or sponges.

# Day 4: Tour to Ilha Grande

Again, at 11 AM we joined a group tour (*Super Lagoa Azul*) to visit several spots around Ilha Grande. The first stop was undoubtedly the best because I found a beautiful orange sea horse, and we had a lot of fun seeing it hold the coral with its tail, so cute!

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_028.png]]

I was really tired this day, and I only did the tour because Leo had already pre-paid it for me. However, it proved to be the best tour, excluding the dives.

Lagoa Azul was beautiful, we plunged into calm sea, about 3 meters+ depth, snorkelling or just floating around. I loved it.

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_019.jpg]]


Grumixama was even better, you could swim to a nearby beach as well, and if you ventured a little further into the sea there was the best snorkel in town: I saw the trip highlight, a cute sea horse, plus two turtles.

*Here I walked a little bit in the jungle!*
# Day 5: Relax hotel day + Angra town

Heat wave across Brazil. The sun blazes most of the day, and the pool is not refreshing as it seems to be > 30 degrees!

We stayed at the Hotel, I napped, read a lot, finished the Millenium's rule series of books... At night the insisted on going to Angra Dos Reis historical center, which was decorated in the most bizarre ways.. endless Christmas decorations very very gaudy and even a little cringe.

![[img_angra_dos_reis_2025_046.jpg]]

We ate dinner at an Italian restaurant, Formaggio, where I tried to eat caneloni but got more cheese than actual pasta.



# Day 6: Angra to Rio, Barra de Tijuca

The heatwave is just unbearable,feels like > 40 degrees. The bus Angra -> Rio took exactly 3 hours, yet it was unconforably crowded.

Once in Rio, we rode an Uber to our hotel Windsor Oceanica in Barra de Tijuca, another 1 hour drive.

We had lunch next to the sea, it was **scorching hot**. Utterly unbearable. After checking in to the room, I was so fed up that I just stayed the afternoon napping until ~5pm when the sun started to weaken.

I had açaí twice that day, perhaps the highlight. I just quickly bathed in the sea, but the heat and the crowds really discouraged me. Then saw the sunset from the hotel rooftop, beautiful yet crowded. The swimming pool water was SO HOT that it provided zero refreshment.

After sunset we visited BarraShopping, a huge mall. Here I had a good time, drank Startbucks, visited a beautiful book shop and purchased a lot of clothing at C&A.

We had lunch at a lively street in Barra de Tijuca, 10 minutes away from our hotel, at a restaurant called BROU located on the waterfront avenue Lucio Costa. I had a delicious dish of tuna with boniato, and my last Caipirinha of the trip.

# Day 7: A slow return home

Early breakfast, Uber to the airport, and wait for a predictably delayed Flybondi flight. I'm making good use of my time by (A) writing this journal and (B) reading my new book "The Shadow of What Was Lost" by James Islington.
