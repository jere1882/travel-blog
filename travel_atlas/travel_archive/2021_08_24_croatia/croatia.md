## Why Croatia?

This was a special trip, perhaps for the wrong reasons, since it happened in one of the most turbulent and sad times of my life, and the destination was mostly imposed on me. Back in 2021, right before graduating from university, I asked my company if they'd sponsor a UK visa for me. Three months later, I was in the apartment where I had lived for a decade, packing my life into two suitcases to board a flight from Argentina to Europe the next day.

I was terrified. It was early COVID times, air traveling was highly restricted, everyone was wearing face masks and countries were imposing strict entry restrictions. At the time, the only way I could get into the UK was spending 13 days in any other country whitelisted by the NHS. Croatia was the only viable option, since it would allow me to fly in from Argentina as long as I presented a negative antigen test. Any other option demanded quarantine in self-paid hotels for two weeks, insane.

So, terrified by the prospect of a new life, leaving behind a special person with whom I was falling in love, I flew in to Dubrovnik to spend a somewhat forced 13-day vacation in Croatia. The truth is that I felt miserable most of this trip, constantly listening to depressing songs and trying to keep my gloomy mood in check. 

It was a challenge to appreciate the beauty of the country, and that will explain why this travel log lacks the details and colours that I usually provide. That said, there were pockets of enjoyment and light that I want to highlight and share in this review.

### Dubrovnik

 The Old Town is beautiful, medieval and charming. I distinctly remember myself listening to Cersei's chapters from GoT in audiobook, endlessly strolling the pebbled streets and walking atop the old city walls.
 
![[img_croatia_2021_001.jpg]]

On the other hand, I was aghast at the crowds. Surprisingly, Covid did not seem to lower the number of tourists, perhaps even the opposite. Clearly I was not the only one to realise that Croatia had a pretty lax admission policy, pretty much anyone wanting a beach escape during COVID come here with little hassle. 
![[img_croatia_2021_002.jpg]]
I also visited many rocky, crystal clear beaches such as Banje Beach. Great city views from the water. I recall swimming with stunning views of medieval fortifications.

![[img_croatia_2021_004.jpg]]

Fun fact 1: I stayed at private airbnb apartment about 30 minutes away from the old town. I left my luggage and left for a walk, but came right back because I had forgotten something. I surprised the dodgy landlord inside my apartment, suspiciously browsing my luggage. An absolute privacy breach!

Fun fact 2: I recall one of the most tremendous thunderstorms I've ever seen raging through the night, in my second or third day there. Impressive.

*Next time, stay closer to old town and go in low season*
### Korčula

![[img_croatia_2021_007.jpg]]
I boarded a 2.30 hour ferry from Dubrovnik to Korčula (pronounced KOR-chu-la). It was madness to climb down the ferry and up the steep narrow streets to the airbnb, carrying two 23 kg oversize suitcases, plus a carry on luggage and backpack. 

![[img_croatia_2021_009.jpg]]

I rented a bike and went into a little island adventure, traversing scenic roads, I mostly remember the vineyards at Lumbarda. And I also remember when the bike tire got flat... halfway back... and I had to walk for kilometers nonstop. 

![[img_croatia_2021_008.jpg]]

![[img_croatia_2021_027.png]]
### Hvar
![[img_croatia_2021_015.jpg]]
A second 1h30 ferry ride took me to beautiful Hvar (pronounced ~far), where you can find an endless shoreline with secluded and deserted beaches.

![[img_croatia_2021_012.jpg]]
I remember myself doing a bunch photo shoots in the stony beach, seeing huge cruise ships sail in the distance.

![[img_croatia_2021_010.jpg]]
![[img_croatia_2021_011.jpg]]

I did a day tour to Pakleni Islands and was utterly disappointed, one of the islands (Jerome) was to my surprise a nudist hotspot and it was full of elderly men; the next one was supposedly a famous "party" island, more like a tourist trap if you ask me (Carpe Diem Beach). 

The highlight was my diving day, I had to take a bus to the other end of the island, Vrboska, to reach the diving center. The town itself was full of canals, like a mini Venetia. 

![[img_croatia_2021_014.jpg]]

According to my diving log, [Hvar Divers](https://www.hvardivers.com/en/) took us to dive at Kabal (15 m deep) and then to "The Aquarium" (13 m deep, number 22).

![[img_croatia_2021_013.jpg]]

According to my (highly unspecific) journal notes, the dives where not impressive - Likely because I was in a super gloomy mood, I'll have to come back and try again!
### Split

The ferry from Hvar terminated in Split, and the bus to Zagreb departed the next day. Ergo, I had a bonus half-day in Split.

![[img_croatia_2021_018.jpeg]]

I strolled for hours the waterfront boardwalk, full of coffee and souvenir shops, plus narrow streets and the highlight: Diocletian's Palace.

![[img_croatia_2021_017.jpeg]]

I remember being particularly impressed by this statue, which looks so much like a sorcerer from a fantasy book, and it's actually Gregory of Nin, a bishop from medieval Croatia who is a national hero, supposedly advocating for defending Croatian culture, language and statehood by e.g. pushing for church services being delivered in Croatian instead of Latin.

![[img_croatia_2021_016.jpeg]]

Fun fact: I distinctly recall buying a day pass in a gym (as I always do), loading excessively my bench press and getting trapped under the bar. What a shame, a random guy had to rescue me!
### Zagreb

Last but not least, the capital city. I am always drawn to capital cities, and this was not the exception, even though Zagreb is often left out of traditional itineraries.

![[img_croatia_2021_019.jpeg]]

I strolled around the main square (Ban Jelačić Square) and the Zagreb Cathedral, a little surprised at times of the run-down appearance of certain side streets and alleys. Welcome to Eastern Europe! 

![[img_croatia_2021_020.jpeg]]

I scheduled a full day to visit the famous Plitvice National Park, which involves a 2-hour bus ride each way from Zagreb. It was beautiful, full of lakes, waterfalls and waterways, small bridges and nature. The colour of the water was just magical, it was a unique deep light blue. Awfully crowded though.

![[img_croatia_2021_022.jpeg]]
![[img_croatia_2021_021.jpeg]]
![[img_croatia_2021_023.jpeg]]
On my last day, with the ever-present gloomy mood that I had this trip, I visited a museum and devoted myself to do COVID tests and prepare the documentation necessary to enter UK next day. I also sent a postcard to that special one I had left in Argentina.

## Highlights

- I remember Ezeiza airport eerily empty, only 6 scheduled international flights all day, full COVID lockdown.
- Riding a bike across vineyards in Lumbarda, Korcula.
- Strolling Dubrovnik city walls while listening to GoT audiobooks.
- Plitvice National Park, despite the crowds.

As you can see, public transportation (especially by ferry) is insanely cheap. Diving was also on the inexpensive side, compared to other destinations I have visited. I also found consistently better prices in Airbnb than in Booking.com, and the apartments were really comfortable.

## Conclusions

This is one of those places that I know I will eventually go back, not only because of the many highlights (Dubrovnik above all), but also as a personal tribute. I was in such a depressive mood that I was not mentally present during this trip, and it would be really meaningful to go back as a statement that things did get better.

One thing is clear though: next time, I will go in low season!
