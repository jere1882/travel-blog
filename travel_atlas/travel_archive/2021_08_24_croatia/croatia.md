# Croatia, by Circumstance

In August 2021, at the height of the COVID pandemic, I found myself wandering through medieval streets that were literally used as sets in Game of Thrones, hopping between sun-washed islands, and diving into impossibly clear Adriatic waters. Croatia revealed itself as a place of stone, sea, and quiet beauty, one that deserved to be explored slowly and without distraction, which is why I will one day be back.

The circumstances that brought me there were anything but idyllic. This was not a trip I had planned or even dreamed of. It was an accidental detour caused by closed borders and COVID quarantine rules, and the trip was filled with the uncertainty of leaving my home in Argentina behind, possibly for years. What followed was a two-week stay in Croatia that was as visually stunning as it was emotionally heavy.

# Why did I go to Croatia?

August 2021 was early COVID times: air travel was highly restricted, everyone was wearing face masks, and most countries had closed their borders. Entering the UK directly from Argentina meant thirteen days of mandatory hotel quarantine, at a staggering cost of around £4000.

After a lot of research, I discovered a loophole: Croatia was the only European country allowing Argentine nationals to enter freely with a simple negative COVID test, and the UK permitted quarantine-free entry for travelers who had spent thirteen days there beforehand.

So I flew to Dubrovnik and found myself on a somewhat forced two-week vacation to Croatia, which was much more preferrable than a solitary hotel room in London. Croatia is a place I hope to return to one day, free of stress, and under very different circumstances.

# Itinerary

![[img_croatia_2021_025.png]]
*Croatia covers about 1800 km of coast along the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. I traveled East to West, starting from Dubrovnik all the way up to Zagreb.*

I decided to spend a good chunk of time in the beautiful city of Dubrovnik, and then ride various ferries to hop between islands up to Split. Finally, I allowed a few days in the often overlooked capital, Zagreb.

- **22/08/2021**: 2.00  Airport Covid pre-flight test. Wait for the results there.
- **23/08/2021**: 11.30  KLM flight. EZE -> AMS -> MAD
- **24/08/2021**: 15.50  MAD -> Dubrovnik
- **24-28**: Dubrovnik
- **28-30** : Korcula
- **30-01**: Hvar
- **01-02**:  Split
- **02-05** : Zagreb (w/ day trip to Plitvice)
- **05/09/2021**: Ryanair ZAG -> STS

> 💡 I remember Ezeiza airport being eerily empty when I showed up, only 6 scheduled international flights all day, full COVID lockdown.

# Dubrovnik

 Dubrovnik, known as "the Pearl of the Adriatic", is one of the most historically rich cities on the Adriatic. Its medieval walled Old Town is beautiful and charming. One of my fondest memories of visiting the city is simply strolling around the pebbled streets and atop the city walls, all while listening to my favourite chapters of the Game of Thrones audiobooks.

 > 💡 Dubrovnik is the filming location of the iconic city King's Landing from the Game of Thrones TV series. The most distinctive locations are the city walls (King's Landing's defenses and battlements), Fort Lovrijenac (the Red Keep), and Jersuit Startcase (the setting for Cersei's "Walk of Shame").

*Stradum, the main pedestrian street in Dubrovnik, as seen from atop the city walls*

On the downside, I was aghast at the crowds. Surprisingly, Covid did not seem to lower the number of tourists, perhaps even the opposite. Clearly I was not the only one to have realized that Croatia had a pretty lax admission policy, allowing anyone wanting a beach escape during COVID to come here with little hassle. 

![[img_croatia_2021_003.jpg]]
*Strolling the medieval walls*

> 💡 Dubrovnik is always crowded, especially in summer. I remember how much I struggled to connect with the city and appreciate its beauty due to the crowds. Next time I will do my best to go in low or shoulder season. 

Over the days I visited many rocky, crystal clear beaches such as Banje Beach, where you can bathe while taking in stunning views of medieval fortifications in the background.

![[img_croatia_2021_004.jpg]]
*One of the many bathing spots, with excellent fortress views*

> 💡 Fun fact: I stayed at private airbnb apartment about 30 minutes away from the old town. I left my luggage and left for a walk, but came right back because I had forgotten something. I surprised the dodgy landlord inside my apartment, suspiciously browsing my luggage. An absolute privacy breach! Beware of Airbnb.

I recall one of the most tremendous thunderstorms I've ever seen raging through the night, in my second or third day there. Summer storms are formidable here!

![[img_croatia_2021_006.jpg]]
*Onofrio's Fountain at Dubrovnik Old Town*

> 💡 Onofrio's Fountain was built in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect Onofrio della Cava as the final point of a 12-kilometre-long aqueduct that brought fresh water from the Šumet area, north of the city.

![[img_croatia_2021_026.png]]
*Next time, stay closer to old town and go in low season*

> 💡 Accommodation is expensive in Dubrovnik, so I booked an apartment a little away from the Old Town. My advice would be to prioritize a location closer to the Old Town, which is where all the attractions are. 

To sum up, must see landmarks in Dubrovnik include:
* The city walls: 2 km of walls, towers, bastions. Really worth climbing up and spending a few hours exploring.
* Stradun: The main pedestrian street, connecting Pile Gate to Ploce Gate
* Fort Lovrijenac: The best viewpoint of the Old Town, and filming location of the Red Keep in GoT
* Rector’s Palace and Sponza Palace within the old town
* Dubrovnik Cathedral and other monasteries: Franciscan Monastery and Dominican Monastery
* Small iconic landmarks: Onofrio's Fountain, Pile Gate and Ploce Gate
* The city is dotted with random ladders dropping into deep clear water, where you can jump into the sea with amazing city views.

# Korčula

I boarded a 2.30 hour ferry from Dubrovnik to Korčula (pronounced KOR-chu-la). Korčula is a beautiful island in the Adriatic Sea, part of Croatia’s Dalmatian coast. It’s known for its dense forests, medieval architecture, and cultural heritage. I stayed in Korcula Town, the main settlement, often called Little Dubrovnik.

![[img_croatia_2021_007.jpg]]
*View of city fortifications in Luka Korculanska Bay, Korcula Town*

> 💡 Try to travel as light as possible to avoid struggling with luggage. It was a nightmare to climb down the ferry and up the steep narrow streets to the airbnb, carrying two 23 kg oversize suitcases. Most buildings are accessed via narrow paths, unreachable by car.

![[img_croatia_2021_009.jpg]]
*Steep path leading up to my airbnb*

One of the highlights of the trip was renting a bike and going on a little island adventure away from the main town, traversing scenic roads. I took a path south-east to the village of Lumbarda, and my favourite part was being completely alone with my bike and surrounded by vineyards. After a few hours of biking, the bike tire got flat, almost halfway back. I had to walk for kilometers nonstop to the main town, which I remember as a funny adventure. 

![[img_croatia_2021_008.jpg]]
*Vineyard and mountain view*

Strolling leisurely along the waterfront is a must:

# Hvar

A second 1h30 ferry ride took me to the beautiful island Hvar (pronounced ~far), where you can find an endless shoreline with secluded and deserted beaches. I stayed in the main town, which is called Hvar, and is famous for its nightlife as well as its Venetian architecture.

![[img_croatia_2021_015.jpg]]

![[img_croatia_2021_012.jpg]]
I remember myself doing a bunch photo shoots in the stony beach, seeing huge cruise ships sail in the distance.

I did a day tour to Pakleni Islands and was utterly disappointed, one of the islands (Jerome) was to my surprise a nudist hotspot and it was full of elderly men; the next one was supposedly a famous "party" island, more like a tourist trap if you ask me (Carpe Diem Beach). This tour was by far the most sold tour, and I don't recommend it at all.

The highlight of Hvar was my diving day, I had to take a bus to the other end of the island, Vrboska, to reach the diving center. The town itself was beautiful and full of canals, like a mini Venetia, and I would consider staying there if I am ever back.

![[img_croatia_2021_014.jpg]]

According to my diving log, [Hvar Divers](https://www.hvardivers.com/en/) took us to dive at Kabal (15 m deep) and then to "The Aquarium" (13 m deep).

![[img_croatia_2021_013.jpg]]

<!--
According to my (highly unspecific) journal notes, the dives where not impressive - Likely because I was in a super gloomy mood, I'll have to come back and try again!
-->

The waterfront of Hvar Town is beautiful to stroll, have a drink and relax.

# Split

The ferry from Hvar terminated in Split, and the bus to Zagreb departed the next day. Ergo, I had a bonus half-day in Split.

![[img_croatia_2021_018.jpeg]]

I strolled for hours the waterfront boardwalk, full of coffee and souvenir shops, plus narrow streets and the highlight: Diocletian's Palace.

![[img_croatia_2021_017.jpeg]]

I was particularly mesmerized by this statue, which looks so much like a sorcerer from a fantasy book, and it's actually Gregory of Nin, a bishop from medieval Croatia who is a national hero, supposedly advocating for defending Croatian culture, language and statehood by e.g. pushing for church services being delivered in Croatian instead of Latin.

![[img_croatia_2021_016.jpeg]]

> 💡 Fun fact: I distinctly recall buying a day pass in a gym (as I always do), loading excessively my bench press and getting trapped under the bar. What a shame! A random guy rescued me.

I know Split is a large city and I only managed to scratch the surface by staying a single night there. Hopefully I will be back and visit properly.

# Zagreb

Last but not least, the capital city. I am always drawn to capital cities, and this was not the exception, even though Zagreb is often left out of traditional itineraries. 

![[img_croatia_2021_019.jpeg]]
*Flixbus operates affordable buses between Split and Zagreb.*

I strolled around the main square (Ban Jelačić Square) and the Zagreb Cathedral, a little surprised at times of the slightly run-down appearance of side streets and alleys. It was my first time in Eastern Europe, and I used to think of pristine Western European cities as the standard across all of Europe.

![[img_croatia_2021_020.jpeg]]
*Zagreb Catholic Cathedral, the second tallest building in the country*

St Mark's Church is one of the city landmarks, its colorful tiled roof depicting the Croatian coat of arms.

On my last day I visited an unusual museum: The Museum of Broken Relationships, dedicated to showcasing objects linked to funny, interesting or emotional breakups. The rest of my day was devoted to doing yet another round of pre-flight COVID tests and preparing the documentation necessary to enter the UK the next day.

To be honest, I was a little absent minded during my days in Zagreb. I feel that I left a few interesting landmarks unchecked, and I hope I can one day go back and write a post that makes it justice. 

# Plitvice National Park

I scheduled a full day to visit the famous Plitvice National Park, which involves a 2-hour bus ride each way from Zagreb. It was beautiful, full of lakes, waterfalls and waterways, small bridges and nature. The colour of the water was just magical, it was a unique deep light blue. Awfully crowded though.

![[img_croatia_2021_022.jpeg]]
![[img_croatia_2021_021.jpeg]]
![[img_croatia_2021_023.jpeg]]

It was really really hard to connect with nature amongst such crowds, and I would really encourage anyone interested to visit to try to skip high season and weekends. Going really early in the morning may be another way to enjoy before tour buses arrive.

# Trip Highlights

My favourite moments and sites from the trip were:
- Riding a bike across vineyards in Lumbarda, Korcula.
- Strolling Dubrovnik city walls while listening to GoT audiobooks.
- Plitvice National Park, despite the crowds. 

# Expenses

Here is an overview of the expenses of the trip, which can hopefully help in planning a future trip. Remember to adjust by inflation, this was 2021, and Croatia hadn't yet joined the Eurozone.

| Plitvice NP Entry                   |                         | 18         |

Public transportation (especially by ferry) was insanely cheap. Diving was also on the inexpensive side compared to other destinations I have visited. I also found consistently better prices in Airbnb than in Booking.com, and the apartments were really comfortable, excluding the one in Dubrovnik.

# Final Thoughts

This is a country that I know I will eventually go back to, not only because of the many highlights (Dubrovnik above all), but also as a personal tribute. I was in such an anxious mood that I was not mentally present during this trip, and it would be really meaningful to go back as a statement that things did get better.

One thing is clear though: next time, I will go in low season!
