## Inverness: The gateway to the Highlands

After my first trip to Edinburgh in 2021, it quickly became clear that I wanted to explore more of Scotland—and the opportunity arrived sooner than expected: a 10-day window to work remotely during the British winter.

I first heard of Inverness through the TV series _Outlander_, and a little research revealed its reputation as "the gateway to the Scottish Highlands." Perfectly positioned for exploring iconic Scottish landmarks—Loch Ness, Skye Island, Urquhart Castle—the city also offers its own charm, with scenic views stretching across the River Ness.

I booked two inexpensive EasyJet flights from Gatwick (around £40 each way), secured a cozy Airbnb, and braved the bitter Scottish winter. What I discovered was more than just a picturesque city: over time, Inverness has become a sanctuary for me, a place to reflect, make big decisions, and simply find calm amid the beauty of the Highlands.

## Itinerary

![[Pasted image 20250818004845.png]]

I based myself in Inverness (red), and thoroughly enjoyed the city in my free breaks while working remotely. I also took two amazing full day tours where I got to visit Loch Ness and Skye Islands, as well as a couple of Scottish castles.

### Inverness

Inverness is a rather small city, with a population of 45000 and a compact, scenic city center. The city is split in two by the River Ness, and I was lucky enough to get a great apartment one block away from the Old Town, right across the river.

Bridge Street is my favourite street in the city centre, you can find branches of most British franchises in the atmospheric cobbled streets. My absolute favourite coffee shop is Cafe Nero, where I would get a spot next to the window each morning and see the snow fall.

The Old Town is really walkable and compact, and here you can find several quirky shops and historical buildings.

**Leakey's Book Shop** is a must see in the city, here you can all sorts of second hand books, maps and prints.

The unicorn, Scotland's emblem, stands high in this beautiful obelisk in front of the Eastgate mall.

The river Ness is offers exquisite views of the city from both sides:

![[img_inverness_2022_007.jpeg]]

A must-do activity in Inverness is to walk down the river to the Ness Islands, following peaceful footpaths and taking in the views. It takes about 4 hours to do the full loop.

Inverness is full of churches, although most of them were closed when I tried to visit. They look scenic from the outside:

![[img_inverness_2022_008.jpeg]]

The city is extremely peaceful in winter, with virtually zero tourists, the occasional snowfall and a very small town vibe. I enjoyed working remotely from the coffee shops, walking up the river to the gym, and doing some outstanding day trips (detailed below).

### Inverness Castle

The castle overlooks the city, although it has been closed for years due to renovation works. Apparently the city is pouring a lot of money to make it quite impressive.

At the time of my visit, you could see the exteriors, and it looked like this:

The is a very small museum next door (Inverness Museum), which had extremely reduced opening hours and it's not really worth visiting.

### Day Trips: Loch Ness, Fort Augustus, Castles and Skye Island

I reserved a spot in one of Rabbie's day trips to visit the famous Loch Ness, where the monster Nessie is supposed to live. To be honest, the lake is nondescript and the landmark itself is a tourist trap. Of course, you're not going to see anything resembling Nessie, other than a lot of inventive souvenirs.

*Loch Ness, which looks just like any other lake*

Excluding Loch Ness, the tour was really good: great views of the Scottish countryside, which looks magical and eerie in winter due to the mist and shifting weather.

The gem of this day trip was **Urquhart Castle**, one of the most iconic castles about 20 km south west of Inverness.

Founded around the 13th Century, it overlooks Loch Ness and offers stunning views. It is nowadays a medieval ruin, featuring walls, towers and gatehouses.

![[img_inverness_2022_024.jpeg]]

One day I hope to visit the ruins on my own and take my time to stroll around. The guided tour only allowed a brief stop.

On a second day trip, I got to visit a slightly less-ruined casle: **Eilean Donan castle**. It's imposingly located on a small island and connected to the mainland by a stone bridge.

![[img_inverness_2022_025.jpeg]]

Built in the 13th century to defend against Viking invasions, it was destroyed in 1719 during the Jacobite uprising and subsequently restored in the early 20th Century.

This second day tour involved a lot of driving to reach **Skye Island**, located west of Scotland. The cute fishing villages were very photogenic (despite the terrible weather):

![[img_inverness_2022_029.jpeg]]

The main city, Portree, is famous for its colorful facades:

![[img_inverness_2022_030.jpeg]]

The open landscapes in Skye and the West Highlands are majestic and well worth the long drive:

## Feelings

I landed in Inverness at a turning point in my life. I was caught in an existential crisis, weighed down by anxiety and a heavy sadness I’d never known before. Still, I remember walking along the frozen path by the river after leaving the gym, and for a moment, finding peace in the quiet stillness of the city.

Even in that dark time, I managed to see the beauty of the Highlands, and that meant something. Catching a glimpse of beauty—even if only briefly—felt like a small lifeline.

I returned to Inverness years later, not just for the landscape but to rewrite the difficult memories of that first visit. I stayed in the same apartment, walked the same streets, and gave the past a different ending—one filled with hope instead of despair. Three years on, I was more mature, more prepared to face whatever life would bring. Pain, I realized, is rarely wasted; it often carves the space we need to grow.
