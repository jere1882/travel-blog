# Inverness: The gateway to the Highlands

After I fell in love with Scotland on my first trip to [Edinburgh in 2021](/trip/edh_2021), it quickly became clear that I wanted to explore more of the country, and the opportunity arrived sooner than expected: a 10-day window to work remotely during the British winter.

I first heard of Inverness through the TV series _Outlander_, and a little research revealed its reputation as "the gateway to the Scottish Highlands." Perfectly positioned for exploring iconic Scottish landmarks (Loch Ness, Skye Islands, etc.), the city also offers its own charm, with scenic views stretching across the River Ness.

I booked two inexpensive EasyJet flights from Gatwick (around £40 each way), secured a cozy Airbnb, and braved the bitter Scottish winter!

# Itinerary

![[img_inverness_2022_036.jpeg]]

I based myself in Inverness for 10 days (red), which is basically the northernmost city in the UK with acceptable infrastructure for a digital nomad. It's reachable both by train and by air, reasonably well connected to all nearby attractions, has a small number of tour operators and the regular franchises you expect to find in any small UK city (Tesco supermarket, a few coffee shops, Puregym, etc).

I enjoyed the city during my free breaks on the days I was working, plus two amazing full-day tours where I got to visit Loch Ness, a few castles, and Skye Islands. All the details below.

> 💡 Inverness is the ideal base for visiting tourist spots in the highlands as day trips. The weather can be snowy and hostile in winter, so I opted for organized tours. In summer, I can imagine renting a car and driving around the countryside.

# Inverness City

Inverness is a rather small city, with a population of 45000 and a compact, scenic city center. The city is split in two by the River Ness, and I was lucky enough to get a great apartment one block away from the Old Town, right across the river.

## Bridge St, Inverness Town House, Leakey's Book Shop

*Bridge St, the main pedestrian street, is dotted with shops and leads straight to a bridge crossing the River Ness*

Bridge Street is my favourite street in the city centre, you can find branches of most British franchises in the atmospheric cobbled streets. My absolute favourite coffee shop is a cozy Cafe Nero, where I would get a spot next to the window each morning and see the snow fall.

Winter is a great time to be here, because it's low season, and the town feels quiet and slow. I noticed that most of the people around were locals, as the coffee shop baristas would greet the usual customers by name, often old ladies that meet to have a chat. 

A few interesting sites are next to this main street. Inverness Town House (historically the Town Hall) looks like a small castle, and two wolf gargoyles guard the entrance.

**Leakey's Book Shop** is a must-see in the city, a quirky shop full of second-hand books, maps, and prints. I spent a few hours here, especially since I kept coming back and finding hidden treasures, and the place is fairly large.

## The River Ness

The River Ness offers exquisite views of the city from both sides:

![[img_inverness_2022_007.jpeg]]

A must-do activity in Inverness is to walk down the river to the Ness Islands, following peaceful footpaths and taking in the views. It takes about 4 hours to do the full loop.

![[img_inverness_2022_010.jpeg]]

![[img_inverness_2022_009.jpeg]]

Those quiet walks following the river were calming and inspiring to me. You'll see a number of bridges and soon be out of the town, walking into small groves that remind you of the Celtic roots of this land.

## Churches

Inverness is full of churches, although most of them were closed when I tried to visit. They look scenic from the outside, and you can pass by them during the river walk:

> 💡 The city is extremely peaceful in winter, with virtually zero tourists, the occasional snowfall, and a very small town vibe. I enjoyed working remotely from the coffee shops, walking up the river to the gym, and strolling the cobblestoned streets leisurely. The day trips, on the other hand, were long and demanding, but rewarding.

## Inverness Castle & Inverness Museum

The castle overlooks the city, although it has been closed for years due to renovation works. Apparently the city is pouring a lot of money to make it quite impressive.

> 💡 As of January 2026, the castle is still undergoing major restoration

At the time of my visit, you could see the exteriors, and it looked like this:

![[img_inverness_2022_006.jpeg]]

![[img_inverness_2022_005.jpeg]]

There is a very small museum next door (Inverness Museum), which had extremely reduced opening hours and it's not really worth visiting.

# Day Trip: Loch Ness, Fort Augustus & Urquhart Castle

I reserved a spot in one of Rabbie's day tours to visit the famous Loch Ness, where the monster Nessie is supposed to live. To be honest, the lake is absolutely ordinary, and it felt a little bit like a tourist trap. Of course, you're not going to see anything resembling Nessie, other than a lot of inventive souvenirs.

> 💡 [Rabbies](https://www.rabbies.com/en-gb) is a Scottish tour operator. At the time of my visit they were the only company running tours in winter, with very affordable prices, small groups and good guides. You can get a discount if you have ISIC student ID. 

![[img_inverness_2022_016.jpeg]]
*Loch Ness, which looks just like any other lake*

Incidentally, I learned that the Scots use a few different words that I kept hearing over and over:

| Scottish | English |
|------|---------|
| loch | lake |
| glen | valley |
| kirk | church |


![[img_inverness_2022_021.jpeg]]

After Loch Ness, the tour was really good: great views of the Scottish countryside, which looks magical and eerie in winter due to the mist and shifting weather.

The gem of this day trip was **Urquhart Castle**, one of the most iconic castles about 20 km south west of Inverness.

Founded around the 13th Century, it overlooks Loch Ness and offers stunning views. It is nowadays a medieval ruin, featuring walls, towers and gatehouses.

![[img_inverness_2022_024.jpeg]]

One day I hope to visit the ruins on my own and take my time to stroll around. The guided tour only allowed a brief stop.

# Day Trip 2: Eilean Donan Castle & Skye Island

On a second day trip, I got to visit a slightly less-ruined castle: **Eilean Donan Castle**. It's imposingly located on a small island and connected to the mainland by a stone bridge.

![[img_inverness_2022_025.jpeg]]

Built in the 13th century to defend against Viking invasions, it was destroyed in 1719 during the Jacobite uprising and subsequently restored in the early 20th Century.

This second day tour involved a lot of driving to reach **Skye Island**, located west of Scotland. The cute fishing villages were very photogenic (despite the terrible weather):

![[img_inverness_2022_029.jpeg]]

The main town, Portree, is famous for its colorful facades:

![[img_inverness_2022_030.jpeg]]

The open landscapes in Skye and the West Highlands are majestic and well worth the long drive:

# Expenses

Here is an overview of the trip costs in January/February (low season) of 2022.

| Item                                            | Details                                     | Cost (GBP) |
| -- | - | - |
| Flight London → Inverness                       | Easyjet, with one checked bag               | 50         |
| Flight Inverness → London                       | Easyjet, with one checked bag               | 59         |
| Accommodation                                    | Entire apartment at Booking.com - 14 nights | 612        |
| Rabbie Day Tour - Skye & Eilean Donan           | Student discount applied                    | 39         |
| Rabbie Day Tour - Complete Loch Ness Experience | Student discount applied                    | 21         |

The low season helped a lot to keep these costs very low: The same apartment booking and Rabbie tours cost twice as much in high season.

# Feelings & Final Thoughts

I have a particular love for Scotland — and especially Inverness — that I feel for no other place in the world. The Highlands have kept alive a Celtic identity that was elsewhere all but erased, and the region is steeped in magical and mythological legends. The old language, Scottish Gaelic, is still alive here. Combined with the stunning landscapes and vibrant colors, it feels so real that you almost expect to spot a fairy or some other mystical creature lurking behind the trees.

I first landed in Inverness at a turning point in my life. I was in the midst of an existential crisis, weighed down by anxiety and sadness. I remember walking along the frozen paths by the river after the gym, and suddenly finding peace in the quiet stillness of the city at night. Savoring several cups of coffee from a cozy café while watching the snow fall also helped ease my worries during that difficult time.

The day trips added the much-needed dose of action and adventure to this trip. The landscapes of Skye Islands, the view of Portree, and the many dark castles we visited were undoubtedly highlights of the trip.

Years later, in late 2024, feeling much happier, I returned to Inverness to rewrite the memories of my first visit. I stayed in the same apartment, walked the same streets, and this time gave the past a happier ending. I have no doubt that I will be back!
