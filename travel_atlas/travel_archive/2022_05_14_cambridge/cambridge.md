## Cambdrige : Day Trip from London


I probably first heard about Cambridge when I was a teenager. Back then, Cambridge University’s name appeared on the covers of our English textbooks, and the _Cambridge English_ exams were popular among young foreign students learning the language.

Fast forward a decade, and I finally found myself there, visiting on a day trip from London. The city felt like stepping into a fairytale: pristine college courtyards, spires rising above the river, and medieval buildings that seemed untouched by time. It was a busy day packed with beauty, history, and that unmistakable university magic that defines Cambridge.

## Itinerary

### Getting to Cambridge

Joined by my friend Aldana, I purchased an open-return ticket from London's King's Cross to Cambridge Station at just 19.50 GBP. The fare (super off peak return) is extremely cheap for UK standards, and seems to be only available during weekends. In as little as 49 minutes we were at Cambridge Station, fuelled by a delicious cappuccino and ready to explore!

### The FitzWilliam Museum

The Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum of the **University of Cambridge**, founded in 1816 when Richard FitzWilliam bequeathed his art collection, library and funds to the university. 

The museum holds over 500,000 objects from ancient Egypt and Greece to modern and contemporary art. Entry to the museum is free. Here are my highlights:

![[img_cambridge_2022_002.jpeg]]

![[img_cambridge_2022_003.jpeg]]
*Medieval weapons and armour*
![[img_cambridge_2022_041.png]]
*Antinous as the god Dionysos (~AD 130)*

![[img_cambridge_2022_004.jpeg]]
*Roman mosaic depicting a garden scene, found in Baiae (southern Italy). 1st Century*

![[img_cambridge_2022_005.jpeg]]
![[img_cambridge_2022_006.jpeg]]

![[img_cambridge_2022_007.jpeg]]
*The Neoclassicial building is an attraction on its own*
![[img_cambridge_2022_008.jpeg]]
*A medieval book illustrating the relationship between the human body and the astrological signs. Each zodiac sign was believed to influence a part of the body.*
![[img_cambridge_2022_009.jpeg]]
![[img_cambridge_2022_042.png]]
*Albrecht Dürer's work "The World as a Sphere" is the first known printed map to depict the Earth as a sphere, created in 1515 in collaboration with astronomer Johann Stabius*

### Colleges

The main allure of the city is to visit the many colleges that constitute Cambridge University. Cambridge University is a collegiate university, meaning it’s made up of a federation of individual colleges, each with its own history, architecture, and traditions.

The 31 member colleges are self-governing institutions within the university. 

The university institution handles: exams, teaching core courses, exams, research, degrees. The colleges handle: living, accommodation, mentoring, supervisions and social life.

#### Pembroke College

A relatively modest college compared to others in the city, Pembroke College was founded in 1347 by Marie de St Pol. It has around 700 students. The college feels intimate rather than grandiose.

![[img_cambridge_2022_011.jpeg]]

#### Corpus Christi College

![[img_cambridge_2022_012.jpeg]]

Founded in 1352, it is the only Cambridge college founded by local townspeople rather than royalty or clergy. It houses the Parker Library (which I did not visit), one of the most important collections of medieval manuscripts in the world.

It's rather on the smaller, quieter side; with just about 500 students.

![[img_cambridge_2022_013.jpeg]]
*Beautiful entry at Trumpington Street, a few steps south of King's Parade*

#### King's College

One of the most famous and visually stunning colleges of the University of Cambridge and an icon of the city:
* Founded in 1441 by King Henry VI
* Full name: "The King’s College of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas in Cambridge"
* Around 1000 students

![[img_cambridge_2022_043.png]]

![[img_cambridge_2022_014.jpeg]]
*King's College Chapel East facade, as seen from King's Parade - Lively and full of students*

*Front Court*

*Front Court, with view of Porter's Gate*

![[img_cambridge_2022_017.jpeg]]
*Beautiful details of the Chapel*

![[img_cambridge_2022_018.jpeg]]
*Chapel interior*

The Chapel is just stunning, perhaps one of the most memorable places from my visit. I remember lying down on a bench, mesmerized by the patterns in the ceiling.

It is an example of late Gothic Architecture, characterized by vertical lines, large stained glass windows, intricate fan vaulting and a sense of grand symmetry. The fan vaulting is indeed the largest of its kind in the world, an engineering and artistic masterpiece.

The Chapel was commissioned in 1446 by Henry VI ; and completed 70 years after in 1515.

![[img_cambridge_2022_019.jpeg]]
*The wooden choir, between the entrance in the West end and the altar in the East end. The organ was playing for the duration of our visit*

![[img_cambridge_2022_020.jpeg]]

![[img_cambridge_2022_021.jpeg]]
*I relaxed and admired the place for a good while*

![[img_cambridge_2022_022.jpeg]]
*Beautiful stained windows behind the altar*
![[img_cambridge_2022_023.jpeg]]
![[img_cambridge_2022_024.jpeg]]

The back lawn of the campus extends to River Cam itself:

*River Cam, alive with tourists and gondolas*

#### Christ's College

Founded in 1505 by Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII, it is one of the prettiest and historically rich colleges in Cambridge. It has about 1000 students.

Fun fact: Charles Darwin studied here.

![[img_cambridge_2022_029.jpeg]]

We didn't stay long here, I presume that only the main yard was open to visit.

#### St John's College

The last college in our tour of colleges, one of the oldest, largest and most prestigious colleges in Cambridge. Founded in 1511 by Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII.

The college has over 1100 students and academics, and each year about 170 undergraduates are admitted.  In our visit we were only able to quickly glimpse the inner courtyard, and the interior of the chapel (which was not particularly remarkable after all we had seen before).

## Other Landmarks

### Lunch break at Cambridge Market Square

Conveniently located halfway our walking tour of campuses was the market, offering all sorts of international fast food. I may be making this up, but I'm pretty sure I had a great Greek Gyro here.

![[img_cambridge_2022_027.jpeg]]

Market Street is fully pedestrian and has many interesting shops.

![[img_cambridge_2022_028.jpeg]]

### The Round Church

Officially known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, it's one of the most iconic landmarks of the city. Sadly it was not open for visitors when we arrived, so we could only see the exterior.

Built around 1130, it's one of the few round medieval churches that survived in England. The round design is modelled after the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, reflecting the influence of the Crusades and the desire of returning knights to replicate sacred architecture.

![[img_cambridge_2022_031.jpeg]]

![[img_cambridge_2022_030.jpeg]]

This is what a looked like in 1809:

![[img_cambridge_2022_044.png]]
### Cambridge University Press Bookshop

![[img_cambridge_2022_033.jpeg]]

I was a thrilled to enter the official bookshop and find in the shelves all the English textbooks I had studied for the FCE, CAE and CPE tests.

### Mathematical Bridge

Designed by architect **William Etheridge** and constructed in **1749** by builder **James Essex the Younger**, the bridge is renowned for its innovative use of straight timbers to form a curved structure
![[img_cambridge_2022_037.jpeg]]
The wooden footbridge spans the River Cam in Cambridge, England. It's located at **Queens' College**, connecting the older part of the college, known as the "dark side," with the newer western section, referred to as "The Island" or the "light side".

![[img_cambridge_2022_038.jpeg]]

![[img_cambridge_2022_036.jpeg]]
### Corpus Clock

Also known as Chronophage ("time eater"), this golden clock is located outside Corpus Christi College. It was unveiled in 2008 by Stephen Hawking, and  you'll quickly notice a rather ugly creature (a cricket perhaps), which symbolises time devouring itself as it passes.

I didn't like it, and I didn't feel inspired in any way, which is supposed to be the point of the whole contraption. 

### Sunset

We caught a beautiful sunset view from the window of our train ride back to London.

## A brief history of Cambridge

Located on the River Cam in easter England, 80 kilometres North of London, Cambridge has a story that stretches back nearly **two thousand** years.

| **Period / Era**                       | **Date Range**               | **Key Events and Developments**                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roman & Early Settlement**           | 1st–5th centuries CE         | Roman trading post established near the River Cam. Early settlement continues after Roman withdrawal.                 |
| **Saxon Period**                       | 5th–11th centuries           | Saxons found _Grantebrycge_ (“bridge over the River Granta”). Town grows as a small market center.                    |
| **Norman & Medieval Town**             | 11th–13th centuries          | Normans build Cambridge Castle after 1066. Town prospers via trade along the River Cam.                               |
| **Foundation of the University**       | Early 13th century (c. 1209) | Scholars fleeing Oxford unrest settle in Cambridge, founding the University of Cambridge.                             |
| **Renaissance & Collegiate Expansion** | 14th–16th centuries          | Major colleges founded (King’s, Trinity, St John’s). Cambridge becomes a major intellectual and architectural center. |
| **Industrial & Victorian Period**      | 19th century                 | Railway (1845) links Cambridge to London. Town expands beyond the university; scientific research grows.              |
| **Modern & Scientific Cambridge**      | 20th century–present         | Breakthroughs such as discovery of DNA structure and advances in computing. Emergence of “Silicon Fen” tech cluster.  |
In a way, Cambridge university originated as a byproduct of Oxford. Around **1209**, scholars fled Oxford after violent disputes with townspeople and resettled in Cambridge, forming what became the **University of Cambridge**. So, while Cambridge existed as a town before, its global fame and much of its development stem from that migration.
