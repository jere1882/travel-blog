## Intro

This is an unusual post, in the sense that it is a repository of the many different adventures I've had in London while working for a British company. London was my base for a nomadic lifestyle that lasted 3.5 years, and although I must have spent 6 months actually living in London, I managed to discover my own set of favourite landmarks and hidden corners.

Here are the main batches of stays, followed up by proper sections

Sept 2021 - Stay at Nadi's HOH home
Oct-Nov 2021 - Stayed at airbnb + Santi's

Mid Jan 2022 - ??  -> stayed at Santi's
May 2022 -   -> Stayed at Bethnal Green's apartment 

## 2021 Sept 

* ~7/9/21 : Strolled around Westminster Abbey, Westminster Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, Westminster Cathedral ; Kings Cross

* I stayed about two weeks in Harrow on the Hill, and this was the beautiful hill path that I'd take to go to the gym or get to the tube station.

*The London Eye at night, from the opposite site of the River Thames. I used to love to bike around this area.*

* 22/7/21 - Warner Bros Studio Tour - See the dedicated section

## Oct through Dec 2021

* ~Oct - Dec 1 2021: Another month in London.

*Scenic pub in Harrow*

*A typical bus*
I visited e.g. minalima, infiinite times picadilli circus, etc.

I stayed at a sketchy airbnb for a week, then at santi's apartment in central london. It was crazily cold! Checkout IMG_4527.MOV for a reminiscing video of me walking back at midnight from the gym.

The view from Santi's apartment: on the (rare) clear day, you could see the London Eye and Westminster Palace from the window. Premium location!

![[img_london_2021_023.jpg]]

I used to walk around this neighbourhood every day to go to the gym, groceries, etc.
![[img_london_2021_024.jpg]]

On december 2 2021 I visited the Harry Potter Photographic Exhibition, which I loved:

I was most likely listening to HP audiobooks or sountrack while walking around watching rare photos :)

checkout the full pictures in 2021 london second folder. They are frankly impressive and I have dozens of them.

My mental health was a just a little better than a couple of months before, but at that time I used to live in a permanent state of crisis, melancholy, depression and deep anxiety.

At this point I became really used to riding the Santander bikes (aka Boris' Bikes), hich were really inexpensive, like 2 GBP a day. You could use them as many times as you want a day, 30' max before you need to drop it for a 30' cooldown. Really useful to get around, often faster than bus in the city center.

![[img_london_2021_037.jpg]]

I used to cross the bridges over the Thames all the time

![[img_london_2021_038.png]]
Central London is frankly one of the most beautiful places in the world, but the rent is simply prohibitive. Also at times is not that liveable, e.g. being 30 min away from the closest gym, traffic, etc.

![[img_london_2021_039.jpg]]

![[img_london_2021_040.jpg]]

At this point I also tried to integrate a little more, I attended volleyball sessions. It was really far away, like 1 hour travel each way. As I was saying, Central London is not the most liveable place to be. It's touristy, full of offices, and yeah a degree of residency buildings of wealthy people.

*Late night stroll near the Thames*

Non-main entrance of Buckingham Palace

![[img_london_2021_044.jpg]]
Picadilli circus at night

![[img_london_2021_045.jpg]]
I just loved these hypnotic trees in winter


I naturally strolled around near 111 buckingham palace rd, former irbt headquarters, and the british museum.

At this time of life I was totally in night owl mode, I'd see the light of day 3-4 hours a day at most, because of the short days in winter plus my late starts. Here is picadilli at night, all prepared for Christmass:

The obelisk in the distance:

![[img_london_2021_058.jpg]]

Westminster abbey at night, back from the gym:

![[img_london_2021_055.jpg]]
I often biked to a larger gym, located at the south of the Thames:
![[img_london_2021_056.png]]
Trafalgar Square was another of my favourite spots, to drink a cup of coffee or to go to the National Gallery which had extended hours on Friday.
![[img_london_2021_076.jpg]]

A few last pictures from December 2021, right until I flew back to Argentina for the holidays:

![[img_london_2021_059.jpeg]]

![[img_london_2021_061.jpeg]]

Back in London, I stayed another couple of weeks in Westminster (The second half of January), and took part in Bella's christening as her Godfather :)

![[img_london_2021_062.jpeg]]

I recall the feeling that I was living in a Polar Night. Since I am not a morning person, I'd wake up around 11 AM only to find out that it was already dark by 4 pm. And as a night owl, I was going to the gym at midnight, walking the deserted London streets, often listening at Depeche Mode:

Imposing Westminster School, a boarding secondary school.

The cute path from HOH station to my sister's house in Harrow on the Hill.

*Photogenic neighbourhoods in Westminster*

![[img_london_2021_072.jpeg]]
*Westminster Palace*

I left the Westminster apartment at the end of January. It's funny, perhaps the most beautiful place I've ever lived in, in arguably the most beautiful neighborhood in London. Yet, I was not happy. 2021-2022 were dark times in life, and I struggled to keep depression and axiety at bay. I wish I had been in a better shape to appreciate the beauty around me.

I had to go trough all of this to become stronger. Westminster brings back a deep feeling of darkness ; yet the light was not that far, just a few more turns into the tunnel.

## May 2022



## British Museum
Another of my must-see and favourite places in London, which I must have visited a dozen of times.
![[img_london_2021_047.jpg]]

![[img_london_2021_048.jpg]]

To be honest I was often completely pissed off by the school kids, absolutely noisy and making it impossible to appreciate the place. So I learned to skip school hours.

![[img_london_2021_049.jpg]]

My favourite section was always the Egyptian one. It was the most popular one overall, always crowded.

## MinaLima shop

This is a must-see visit of pretty much all my strolls around Central London. A shop from the designers of harry potter, always featuring original designs.

## WB Studio Tour

I visited this place so many times :)

# Gyms

## PureGym

My favourite one, very inexpensive yet with high quality equipment, infinite locations in all of UK and usually 24 hours.
My favourite one has probably been London Picadilli, which I used to attend at insane hours (like mid night in winter), then I'd walk back past Westminster Cathedral listening Depeche Mode.

# Shops

UK is really dominated for the same franchises. You will find the same coffee shop chains, the same bookstore chains, the same clothing chains, etc, in any little town around. My favourites next.
## Waterstones

Beautiful bookstores, well provided. Any mid to small sized town in UK will have a Waterstones branch. I never miss a chance to browse the scify and fantasy sections. The largest and best one is in London, naturally ; but in general any Waterstones is going to be ok.

![[img_london_2021_026.jpg]]
![[img_london_2021_016.jpg]]

They always have  a charming section for Harry Potter fans.

![[img_london_2021_017.jpg]]

## Groceries

Tesco was my main choice, really good selection of all you may need, plus a point program and discounts with the Tesco Clubcard. And you'd always be at max 10 minutes from a Tesco store, no matter where you are.

![[img_london_2021_046.jpg]]
Sainsbury's was the alternative.

## Coffee Shops

Basically you have Nero, Costa and Starbucks everywhere.

I used to love Nero. Then I started to prefer Starbucks. Nero is always cozy, with sofas and wooden tables and a homely feeling.

![[img_london_2021_053.jpg]]![[img_london_2021_073.jpeg]]

Around this time I became a big fan of Boris' bikes (public Santander bikes), and I'd bike everywhere (usually at random times during the night, perhaps across the river to a gym 30' away).
