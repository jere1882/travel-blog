## Intro

This was an exceptionally short trip that I orchestrated for a weekend escape from London. Ireland had always been in my bucket list, and I saw a chance to escape here for my 28th birthday. A little lonely perhaps, since I spent the day with strangers touring castles, but a childhood dream come true at the same time.

This trip definitely deserved to be longer, and I am sure I left too many wonders unexplored. I look forward to coming back soon!

## The trip in photos

### Dublin

Trinity College: A working university since 1592, bustling with  students and professors..

![[img_ireland_2021_002.jpg]]
The Long Room at the Old Library at Trinity College: One of the most break-taking places I've ever seen, literally looking like a wizard's library. See the next section for a gallery of pictures.

National Gallery of Ireland
![[img_ireland_2021_013.jpg]]
Walking around Dublin. Shelbourne Hotel, with its Nubian Princess statue:
![[img_ireland_2021_014.jpg]]
St Stephen's Green Park is the Central Park of the City, I strolled around quickly:
![[img_ireland_2021_015.jpg]]
I also visited the National Museum of Ireland, where I seem to have spent most of my time in the Archaeology exhibit. 
![[img_ireland_2021_016.jpg]]

Dublin is traversed by the River Liffey, and my favourite bridge is definitely Samuel Beckett Bridge, which looks like a harp (the national symbol of Ireland)
![[img_ireland_2021_044.png]]

Dublin Castle doesn't really look like a castle, since the original castle was destroyed in 1684 by a fire. What we see today is mostly a Georgian-style palace from the 18th century, with a few medieval structure sections.

The complex is more of a multi-building government and historical site. The Upper Courtyard is the main plaza:

![[img_ireland_2021_032.jpeg]]

![[img_ireland_2021_033.jpeg]]

Here I did the visit of the State Apartments from the 18th century, residence for the Viceroy who represented the British monarch in Ireland. On 1922, the last ever Viceroy handled Dublin Castle over to the government of the newly-independent Irish state. Since then, each president has been inaugurated in St Patrick's Hall.

![[img_ireland_2021_031.jpeg]]

St Patrick's Hall:

![[img_ireland_2021_034.jpeg]]

The Chapel Royal, part of the same complex, is a Neo-Gothic church built in 1814. On the right is the Record Tower, the only surviving medieval tower in the complex.

![[img_ireland_2021_035.jpeg]]

Bedford Hall is one of the internal halls within the complex:

![[img_ireland_2021_030.jpeg]]

From there, I moved on to glimpse the cathedrals:

![[img_ireland_2021_036.jpeg]]
Christ Church Cathedral, which looks impressively as a magical palace or a school of wizards.

![[img_ireland_2021_037.jpeg]]

St Patrick's Cathedral (1191), one of the iconic buildings of the city. Who was St Patrick??

He was supposed to have lived in the 5th century, born in Roman Britain. At 16 he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken to Ireland as a slave. He worked a shepherd for 6 years and found strength in his captivity through Christian faith. He escaped after God told him to flee in a vision, trained as a priest, travelled back as a missionary and spent decades spreading Christianity in Ireland.

His legacy: He brought Christianity to Ireland. Supposedly there are two verified writings by him and he actually existed, so it's not all a myth. He became a symbol of *Irishness*. 

![[img_ireland_2021_038.jpeg]]

River Liffey is crossed by many picturesque bridges:

### Castle tour on my 28th birthday

I booked a full day tour to three iconic medieval castles, which also gave me the chance to appreciate the lush Irish countryside.

![[img_ireland_2021_046.png]]

## Rock of Cashel

The **Rock of Cashel** is one of Ireland's most iconic sites. It dramatically raises from the surrounding plain on a limestone outcrop:

![[img_ireland_2021_047.jpg]]

It is a medieval complex of ruins with a fascinating history:
* (300 - 1101) The rock serves as the seat of the Kings of Munster
	* St Patrick is supposed to have visited in 450 and allegedly baptized King Aengus here
	* Brian Boru, once of Ireland's greatest High Kings, was crowned here in 977
* (1101 - 1647) Medieval Church Power
	* The Rock is donated to the Church, shifting from royal to religious power
	* The Round Tower (1100), Cormac's Chapel (1130) and a large Gothic cathedral (1235) are built. 
	* Cashel becomes a major spiritual and administrative church center
* (1647 - 1780) Decline and Destruction
	* Sacked in 1647 during the Cromwellian Wars, the site is ruined
	* Gradual abandonment, church functions shift to the nearby town, until the cathedral falls into ruin and roofless
* (1780 - Present) Romantic Ruin, Restoration and Turism

## Blarney Castle & Gardens

I do hate when places become famous for touristy nonsense. Blarney Castle is most famous for its sone, which supposedly has the power of conferring eloquence to all who kill is.

Located near Cork, it was built in 1200 AD and rebuilt in 1446, and currently it's partially in ruins. The stupid eloquence stone legend goes back supposedly to 1314, it's been around for a while.

Nothing really momentous happened here historically speaking, it's more like a charming legendary symbol.

![[img_ireland_2021_021.jpg]]

![[img_ireland_2021_022.jpg]]

During the visit there are some interesting panels providing some backstory, and you get to visit the interior of the non-ruined section.
![[img_ireland_2021_023.jpeg]]
- Badger Cave: A cave that the residents used to flee (with all the gold) when the castle was besieged by Lord Broghill. Invaders only found 2 people.
- The earls bedroom: a private bedroom was a luxury within a castle
- Lots of defensive features (narrow staircases)
![[img_ireland_2021_024.jpeg]]

![[img_ireland_2021_026.jpeg]]

Unfortunately as I was in a tour, I had a very limited time and I couldn't see ALL the details as I would've normally done in e.g. UK.

## Cahir Castle

Pronounce "Care Castle", one of Ireland largest and best-preserved medieval fortress. Unlike Blarney, it has seen real military action and historical events.

![[img_ireland_2021_027.jpeg]]
Built in **1142** by the Butler Family to control a key crossing on River Suir.

In **1599**, during the **Nine Years' War** when Irish chieftains rebelled against English rule, the castle was seized by rebel forces. The English army (under the Earl of Essex) besieged Cahir Castle and eventually broke through using artillery (a novelty).

The castle features massive walls, towers and inner keeps. Real cannonball damage from the 1599 siege is still embedded in the walls.

## Highlight I: The Book of Kells & Old Library

The Long Room is perhaps my favourite room in the world. From my journal: 

*"it is simply the most beautiful place I’ve been to in all my trip to Dublin. Maybe it is because I love libraries and books in general. You can not touch the books, they are ancient, but the place itself has a mystic that make you fell as if you were in a medieval library. The smell of books, the beautiful statues… I was simply marvelled"*

![[img_ireland_2021_003.jpg]]
![[img_ireland_2021_006.jpg]]
![[img_ireland_2021_004.jpg]]
![[img_ireland_2021_005.jpg]]
![[img_ireland_2021_007.jpg]]![[img_ireland_2021_008.jpg]]
![[img_ireland_2021_010.jpg]]
![[img_ireland_2021_011.jpg]]![[img_ireland_2021_012.jpg]]
The Book of Kells is an acient manuscript, one of the oldest original books on Earth. Its history is intricate, having been moved from one place to the other many times, it even was stolen and then recovered. What fascinates me the most are the intricate drawings, made by two young monks and two scribes. They book is carefully displayed, open in one page, and they change the page every 4 months.

![[img_ireland_2021_009.jpg]]

![[img_ireland_2021_045.png]]

I actually skipped the first part of the tour and walked straight to the book. That allowed me about 10 precious minutes where I could just stare at the book alone in the room, the rest of the people still stuck in the previous exhibits. Then I backtracked to the beginning of the exhibit.
## The National Gallery

![[img_ireland_2021_040.jpg]]
*"Portrait of Lady Lavery as Kathleen Ni Houlihan" -  A mythical female figure representing Ireland itself, often depicted as an old woman who transforms into a young queen when Ireland is freed.*
![[img_ireland_2021_042.png]]
*“Mass in a  Connemara Cabin”,  Aloysius O’Kelly,  1883, National Gallery Dublin.*
The painting depicts a **Catholic priest secretly saying Mass in a rural Irish cottage** — likely during the time when Catholic worship was suppressed under British rule (the Penal Laws, 17th–18th centuries).
![[img_ireland_2021_041.jpg]]
*Detail from Erskine Nicol, 'The 16th, 17th (St Patrick's Day), and 18th March', 1856.*
*Saint Patrick (c.385–c.461) was born in Roman Britain. He was kidnapped and brought to Ireland by Irish raiders when he was 16 years old. He escaped to Britain six years later and became a priest, returning to Ireland to convert the pagan Irish to Christianity.* 
*The 17th March, traditionally the day Saint Patrick died, was made an official Christian feast day in the early 17th century. The celebration of Saint Patrick’s Day has been a religious day and a day of festivities, even as far back as the 1800s, as we can see in this painting. It was declared a national Irish holiday in 1900.*
![[img_ireland_2021_043.jpg]]
*Donnybrook Fair - 1859*: An annual event that ran for 600 years until its ultimate abolition in 1868. 

# Final Thoughts

Truth be told, I was going through very rough times around the time of this trip. I had just moved to London, I was failing miserably at adapting, and this trip was a devised as a way to escape for my birthday.

Exploring magical cities like Dublin was one of the reasons why I had always wanted to move to Europe, and I'm glad I managed to visit, even if fleetingly and even if I was a little distracted. I remember the seeing the deepest green I've ever seen in the countryside, and being mesmerized by the most beautiful library in this world.

I owe Ireland a longer, more immersive visit. I hope life gives me the chance soon!
